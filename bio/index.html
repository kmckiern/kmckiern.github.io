    <h3><span>
    Bria Lofano is a mixed media artist from Phoenix, Arizona.  She graduated in 2013 from Arizona State University with a BFA in Art Education.  Shortly after she moved to Portland, Oregon to pursue her studies as well as expand her portfolio.
    <br />
    <br />
    Bria was taught to draw in graphite and charcoal and learned to paint in oils, but acrylic is her main medium.  She has also studied in ceramics, silversmithing, foundry and screen printing.  Currently she is working in abstract styles such as impressionism and post-impressionism; helping give way to her newfound love for palette knife application.  Bria also enjoys sketching birds and is lucky enough to have a live-in model, a budgie named Thor.  She currently resides in Portland with her boyfriend Jeff and their dog Puglsey.
