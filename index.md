Currently, I work on quantum computing applications at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/).

Previously, I worked on computational biophysics with [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org). 

You can find a complete list of my research publications on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5puhOkwAAAAJ&hl=en).
