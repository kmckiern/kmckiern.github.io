I am interested in using simulation and machine learning to better understand biophysical systems.

Over the course of my PhD, I have focused on:
- Optimization of atomistic interaction potentials 
- Markov modeling of protein conformational dynamics 
- Small molecule drug design 

I do this work as a graduate researcher in the lab of [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org).  

You can find a complete list of my research publications on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5puhOkwAAAAJ&hl=en).

Sometimes I write blogs and tutorials.  You can find some of these below.
