I am interested in using machine learning and dynamical simulation to better understand (bio)physical systems. I do this work as a graduate researcher in the lab of [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org). You can find a complete list of my research publications on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5puhOkwAAAAJ&hl=en).

Sometimes I write blogs and tutorials.  You can find some of these below.
