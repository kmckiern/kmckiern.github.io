I am interested in computational modeling (simulation and machine learning) of biophysical systems.


I work on:
- Optimization of atomistic interaction potentials 
- Markov modeling of protein conformational dynamics 
- Interdisciplinary drug design 


I do this work as a graduate researcher in the lab of [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org).  

You can find a complete list of my research publications on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5puhOkwAAAAJ&hl=en).
