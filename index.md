Currently, I'm working on something new.

Previously, I worked on quantum computing algorithms and applications at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/). Before that, I finished a PhD in computational biophysics at Stanford with [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org). 

You can find a complete list of my research publications on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5puhOkwAAAAJ&hl=en).
