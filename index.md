Hi, I'm Keri. Currently, I'm working on using algorithms to solve really hard and important problems.

Previously, I worked on quantum computing algorithms and applications at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/). Before that, I finished a PhD in computational biophysics at Stanford with [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org). You can find some of this research [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5puhOkwAAAAJ&hl=en).

Interests include: simulations, machine learning, computational physics, combinatorial optimization.
