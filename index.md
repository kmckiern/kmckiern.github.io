Hi, I'm Keri McKiernan. Currently, I'm working on something new. I really like training algorithms to solve really hard and important problems.

Previously, I worked on quantum computing algorithms and applications at [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/). Before that, I finished a PhD in computational chemical physics at Stanford with [Vijay Pande](https://www.pandelab.org). 

You can find some of my research here: [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5puhOkwAAAAJ&hl=en).
